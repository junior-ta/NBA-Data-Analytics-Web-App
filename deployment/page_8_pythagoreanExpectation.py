    The regression output tells you many things about the fitted relationship between win percentage and the Pythagorean Expectation. Regression is a method for identifying an equation which best fits the data. In this case that relationship is:
	
	        win% = (Intercept + coef) * p_expectation
	""")

    st.markdown("""
(i) I observed an R-squared of 0.913, indicating a strong relationship between both variables. This means 91.3% of the variance in win_percent is explained by p_expectation
	
(ii) You can see the value of Intercept is -2.8414 and coef is 6.6794. It's this latter value were interested in (Because having a p_expectation of 0 will be crazy!). It means that for every 1 unit increase in p_expectation, the win percentage increases by 6.68 percentage points (on average).

(iii) The standard error (std err) gives us an idea of the precision of the estimate: 0.389 is solid.
	 
    The ratio of the coefficient (coef) to the standard error is called the t statistic (t) and its value informs us about statistical significance. This is illustrated by the p-value (P > |t|) - this is the probability that we would observe the value 6.6794 by chance, if the true value were really zero. This probability here is 0.000 - (this is not exactly zero, but the table doesn't include enough decimal places to show this) which means we can confident it is not zero. By convention, it is usual to conclude that we cannot be confident that the value of the coefficient is not zero if the p-value is greater than .05
