    The regression output tells you many things about the fitted relationship between win percentage and the Pythagorean Expectation. Regression is a method for identifying an equation which best fits the data. In this case that relationship is:
	
	        win% = (Intercept + coef) * p_expectation
	""")

    st.markdown("""
	You can see the value of Intercept is 0.0609 and coef is .8770. It's this latter value were interested in. It means that for every one unit increase in p_expectation, the value of win%  goes up by 0.887.
	
	Two other points to note:
	
	(i) The standard error (std err) gives us an idea of the precision of the estimate. The ratio of the coefficient (coef) to the standard error is called the t statistic (t) and its value informs us about statistical significance. This is illustrated by the p-value (P > |t|) - this is the probability that we would observe the value .8770 by chance, if the true value were really zero. This probability here is 0.000 - (this is not exactly zero, but the table doesn't include enough decimal places to show this) which means we can confident it is not zero. By convention, it is usual to conclude that we cannot be confident that the value of the coefficient is not zero if the p-value is greater than .05
	
	(ii) in the top right hand corner of the table is the R-squared. This statistic tells you the percentage of variation in the y-variable (win%) which can be accounted for by the variation in the x variables (p_expectation). R-squared can be thought of as a percentage - here the Pythagorean Expectation can account for 89.4% of the variation in win percentage.
